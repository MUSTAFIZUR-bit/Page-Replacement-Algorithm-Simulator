Project Title: Page Replacement Algorithm Simulator (FIFO, LRU & Optimal)
Course: CSE316 – Operating Systems
Student Roll No.: 18
1. Project Overview
In an operating system, page replacement algorithms are used to manage memory efficiently when a page fault occurs and the physical memory frames are full. The operating system must decide which page to remove from memory to make space for a new page.
This project, Page Replacement Algorithm Simulator, is a console-based simulation written in C that demonstrates the working of three fundamental page replacement algorithms:
•	First-In First-Out (FIFO)
•	Least Recently Used (LRU)
•	Optimal Page Replacement
The simulator allows the user to input:
•	Number of page references
•	Reference string
•	Number of memory frames
The program then simulates each algorithm step-by-step, displaying HIT / FAULT status and the current frame contents, and finally compares the total page faults produced by each algorithm.
Key Outcomes
•	Understand page replacement strategies
•	Compare algorithm efficiency
•	Analyze page fault behavior
•	Visualize memory frame changes

5. Flow Diagram0 
Flow Diagram Explanation
The flow diagram represents the complete working of the system.
It starts with user input, followed by deadlock detection using matrices.
If deadlock is detected, recovery is performed by aborting a process.
The detection algorithm is re-executed to ensure system safety.
6. Algorithm / Methodology
FIFO Algorithm
•	Pages are replaced in the order they entered memory.
•	The oldest page is removed first.
LRU Algorithm
•	Replaces the page that has not been used for the longest time.
•	Tracks last access time of each page.
Optimal Algorithm
•	Replaces the page that will not be used for the longest time in the future.
•	Requires future reference knowledge.
General Steps
1.	Initialize all frames as empty
2.	For each page request:
o	Check for HIT or FAULT
o	If FAULT and frames are full:
	Apply replacement algorithm
3.	Count page faults
4.	Display results

8. Conclusion & Future Scope
Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates the working of FIFO, LRU, and Optimal page replacement algorithms. By simulating page requests and memory frames, the project helps in understanding how operating systems manage memory and minimize page faults.
The comparison clearly shows that:
•	FIFO is simple but inefficient
•	LRU performs better with locality of reference
•	Optimal gives the minimum possible page faults
Future Scope
•	Add LFU algorithm
•	Add graphical visualization
•	Simulate real-time paging
•	Compare performance with different frame sizes
